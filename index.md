I am an Assistant Professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College (CUNY). My research examines how policing, public housing, and immigration enforcement produce spatial inequality in American cities.

My work focuses on how state power operates through space, discretion, and routine enforcement, with particular attention to racialized governance in public housing neighborhoods and immigrant communities. Methodologically, I use GIS, spatial econometrics, administrative data, and mixed methods.

I am also the founder of **Grimsky**, a policy and data consulting firm supporting racial equity research, policy evaluation, and spatial analysis.
